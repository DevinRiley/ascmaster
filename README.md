ascmaster
=========

Ascmaster is a simple Ruby gem for converting images to ASCII.

Unfortunately it has the worst dependency in the world: rmagick.

To install: ````gem install ascmaster````

Or, if you're using Bundler, add to your Gemfile: ````gem 'ascmaster'````

You can use ascmaster from the command-line.  Just give it the path to a local image file:
````ascmaster path/to/your/image.jpg````
